As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, I would measure the success of the Instagram TV product using a combination of metrics, including:

Engagement: This includes metrics such as views, likes, comments, and shares. I would track engagement metrics over time to see how they are trending and to identify any areas where we can improve.
Audience retention: This metric measures the percentage of viewers who watch a video from start to finish. It is important to track audience retention because it can help us to understand what types of videos our audience is most interested in and to identify any areas where we can improve our content.
Growth: This includes metrics such as the number of active IGTV users and the number of videos uploaded to IGTV. I would track growth metrics over time to see how the product is growing and to identify any areas where we can accelerate growth.

I would do this by implementing this code:
```
# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a Pandas DataFrame from the IGTV database
df = pd.read_csv('igtvdatabase.csv')

# Calculate the average engagement rate for each video
engagement_rates = df['engagement'].mean()

# Plot the average engagement rates over time
plt.plot(engagement_rates)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Average Engagement Rate')
plt.title('IGTV Engagement Rates Over Time')
plt.show()

# Filter the DataFrame to only include videos that are longer than 5 minutes
long_videos = df[df['duration'] > 5]

# Calculate the average audience retention rate for each video
audience_retention_rates = long_videos['audience_retention'].mean()

# Plot the average audience retention rates over time
plt.plot(audience_retention_rates)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Average Audience Retention Rate')
plt.title('IGTV Audience Retention Rates Over Time')
plt.show()

# Filter the DataFrame to only include active users
active_users = df[df['active'] == True]

# Calculate the total number of active users for each day
total_active_users = active_users.groupby('date').count()

# Plot the total number of active users over time
plt.plot(total_active_users)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Total Active Users')
plt.title('IGTV Active Users Over Time')
plt.show()

# Calculate the average engagement rate for IGTV videos by video category
engagement_rates_by_category = df.groupby('category')['engagement'].mean()

# Print the average engagement rate for each video category
for category, engagement_rate in engagement_rates_by_category.items():
    print(f'Category: {category}, Average Engagement Rate: {engagement_rate}')
```

This code creates code that will create three plots:

A plot of the average engagement rate for IGTV videos over time.
A plot of the average audience retention rate for IGTV videos over time.
A plot of the total number of active IGTV users over time.

I will then use the plots to determine the growth rate of IGTV, and the success rate as a result. WIth metrics provided by the management/ business department, we can easily tune and modify our metrics to gauge levels and responses to changes in the product.
